### Chemokinesis control

Naïve T cells in the absence of CCL21 are round and exhibit mostly Brownian motion. (Courtesy of Darrell Irvine. Used with permission.)

### Chemokinesis +CCL21

Naïve T cells in the presence of sufficient CCL21 will polarize and migrate along a protein-coated surface. (Courtesy of Darrell Irvine. Used with permission.)

### Cells in scaffold

{{< resource 39e7be1f-b928-2fcf-4fef-82d55c69a1e1 >}}

Activated T cells are able to migrate through a 3-dimensional porous polymeric scaffold. T cells were stimulated with CCL21 and the polymer was coated with an adhesion protein. (Copyright © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company. Reprinted with permission of John Wiley & Sons., Inc.)
