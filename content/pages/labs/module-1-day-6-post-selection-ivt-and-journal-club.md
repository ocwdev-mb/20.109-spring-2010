Introduction
------------

You'll begin today by setting up your post-column IVT reactions. Then we will move to a nearby classroom for the first round of journal club presentations.

Protocols
---------

### Part 1: IVT

Refer to the {{% resource_link 5edcc5b0-04cc-d6d9-c6f5-b93bf4f13870 "Day 3" %}} protocol to prepare your IVT Master Mix, except this time shoot for a total volume of 40 μL rather than 80 μL per reaction. (Thus, you will add 6.6 μL of RT-PCR mixture to each reaction instead of 13.1 μL as you did before.) Note the time that you put your reactions on the 37 °C heat block.

### Part 2: Journal Club

Half of the students have signed up give their presentations today; the other half will present on Day 8. See the {{% resource_link 96d78713-6ddb-e72b-2a7f-724d9ac77ed6 "Module 1 Journal Club assignment" %}} page for more information.

For Next Time
-------------

*   For everyone...
    *   No additional lab report homework will be due. However, it is strongly suggested that you continue to work on your report, particularly the RT-PCR figure and experimental schematic. As always, I am happy to provide feedback even when I am not providing a grade.
*   If you presented for journal club today...
    *   You should work on Part III of the computational assignment, and hand in a picture of the full-length 8-12 sequence with the requested highlighting on Day 7.
    *   An awareness of your own strengths and weaknesses can often help you improve your future work. After you give your presentation today, write a brief self-evaluation. Specifically, describe (in a short phrase or sentence each) two things that you thought you did well, and two that could use improvement. Feel free to include both big-picture and detail-oriented comments. This assignment is due by email within **48 hours** after your presentation.
