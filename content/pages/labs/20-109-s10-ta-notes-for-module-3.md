This page contains general preparation notes for the teaching assistants supporting the Module 3 labs. Instructors interested in implementing these labs may contact [Agi Stachowiak](http://openwetware.org/wiki/User:AgiStachowiak) for additional fine-tuning information.

General Notes
-------------

Scheme: Each pair of students will make two cultures, with various modifications as proposed on Day 1.

### Key Preparation

Cell derivation from bovine knee joints (from Research 87, Inc.)

*   For full derivation protocols, you may contact [Agi Stachowiak](http://openwetware.org/wiki/User:AgiStachowiak)
*   Chondrocytes
*   2-day process (1 afternoon and 1 morning), then can be frozen away

*   Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
    *   initially a 2-day process to get to plating
    *   5-7 days to grow out (can be frozen at that time temporarily)
    *   then expand for 2 passages over a few days each time, freeze
*   Initial time-intensive part should be done on a non-lab day (Spring Break or President's Day)

Lots of media to prepare. Some components go bad quickly (proline and ascorbate) and should be added on a daily basis to small amounts of media. Other components (pen/strep/amph, non-essential amino acids, etc.) can be added to a full DMEM bottle to make a base medium.

### Note to Instructors Interested in Implementing this Lab

Several changes are being piloted in the summer of 2010 to make the lab more technically robust.  Please contact [Agi Stachowiak](http://openwetware.org/wiki/User:AgiStachowiak) for details.

*   Improve ELISA signal
    *   completed
    *   in short: after the one day of pepsin digestion, one day of elastase digestion should be done in TBS buffer, pH 8.0
*   Add a proteoglycan (PG) assay
    *   completed 
    *   the standard DMMB assay must be modified for alginate cultures
    *   at very low pH, sulfated PG but not alginate are recognized by the DMMB dye
    *   based on Enobakhare, et al. in _Analytical Biochemistry_ 243, 189-191 (1996)
    *   took similar amount of beads as for collagen assay in a 250 μL volume (of papain/digestion buffer) for a good signal
*   Implement qPCR instead of semi-quantitative gel method
    *   in progress

Daily Notes
-----------

### Day 1

No Quiz

**Materials required:**

1.  None: all work today is computer work. Get passing familiarity with the faculty-selected journal articles.

### Day 2

**Materials required:**

*   Make sure to go through each group's plan to know which factors will be modified.

1.  150 mM NaCl in autoclaved water--needs to be sterile filtered
2.  102 mN CaCl2 in autoclaved water--needs to be sterile filtered
3.  Cell culture media
4.  Alginate--needs to be made the day before lab, allowed to dissolve at 4 °C overnight, then sterile filtered

**Day of Lab:**

*   Quiz (prepared by TA)
*   Sterile-filter all alginate on Thursday morning!
*   Media already has NEAA, HEPES, PSA; need to add proline, ascorbate, and FCS/ITS
*   To be autoclaved, per group
    *   2 beakers for CaCl2 bath
    *   1 sterile spatula, plus couple of extra
*   To be aliquoted, per group unless stated otherwise
    *   Per microscope, 50 μL aliquot of Trypan blue in eppendorf tube
    *   15 mL conical with exactly 9 mL of medium (per group, plus couple of extra)
    *   Other media: 4 mL + 4x 20 mL washes + 24 mL of final version = ~125 mL for 15% excess
    *   Have the 24 mL final media in a separate tube, warmed up a bit later, kept cleaner
    *   (2) 20ml aliquots of CaCl2
    *   (4) 20ml aliquots of NaCl per group; bottles with 185 mL should be good per 2 groups
    *   2ml alginate
*   To be set up per hood ahead of time
    *   Aspirators set up and tested
    *   2 pipet aids
    *   2 beakers with CaCl2 (pre-warmed); 2 for second group kept in teaching hood
    *   1 eppendorf tube for counting
    *   both sizes of tips and pipetmen, set on 1 mL and 90 μL, respectively
*   To be available (dry/equipment), per group unless stated otherwise
    *   2 sterile 1 mL syringes and 21 G needles
    *   2 six-well plates
    *   Bunch of 25 mL pipets

**Spring 2010 specific:**

*   T/R media needs
    *   6 of 7 groups will just get regular medium, but some will add additives
    *   1 of 7 groups will get regular medium for one sample, and low-FCS/ITS medium for the other
    *   thus, total CDR medium (20% excess) needed is ~ 900 mL
    *   total special medium needed is ~ 130 mL
*   T/R other needs
    *   1 group adding EDTA (release buffer, really) at 1:50
    *   1 group adding triple proline, means 96 μL per 6 mL
    *   1 group adding double ascorbate, means 3 μL per 6 mL
    *   2 groups playing with pH: will need to pre-test HEPES and NaHCO3 in main lab during first half
    *   1 group doing mechanical compression, will need to figure out set-up during first half (for now, sterilize some slides and weights)
*   W/F media needs
    *   5 of 7 groups will just get regular medium, but some will add additives
    *   1 of 7 groups will get regular medium for one sample, and low-FCS/ITS medium for the other
    *   1 of 7 groups will get stem cell medium
    *   thus, total CDR medium (15% excess) needed is ~ 790 mL
    *   total special medium needed is ~ 65 mL
    *   total stem cell medium needed is ~ 135 mL
*   W/F other needs
    *   1 group adding bFGF at 15 ng/mL, or 0.6 μL per 12 mL, or 6 μL of a 1:10 dilution
    *   1 group is using 51 mM and 204 mM CaCl2, instead of 102 mM - need to prep and filter > 20 mL of each
    *   1 group is using a vortex on one plate - clean and put in separate incubator from rest
    *   1 group gets chondroitin sulfate - need to prepare appropriate stock
*   Media exchanges over course of module
    *   Should be 3x for each group with all wells, then 2x more with half wells remaining
    *   Therefore, per section will need approx. 700 mL media more for semester, or ~ 1.5 L on top of the ~ 1 L needed on the first day
