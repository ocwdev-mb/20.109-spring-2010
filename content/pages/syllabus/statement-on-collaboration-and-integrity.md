All documentation of your experiments must be written entirely by you. Thus, while we encourage you to discuss your results with your lab partner and other classmates, you may not share text or figures. Please do not plagiarize (accidentally or otherwise) the class wiki, or any other writing/images available online or elsewhere. Note that plagiarism is often unintentional, and take the responsibility now to learn the difference between appropriate paraphrasing and academic dishonesty. The following links may help you in this endeavor:

*   [MIT Libraries Overview on Citation](http://libguides.mit.edu/content.php?pid=80743&sid=598642), especially
    *   Brief paraphrasing example: "[Using the Language of Your Source Appropriately](http://www.mhhe.com/mayfieldpub/tsw/source.htm)." Section 10.1 in Perelman, L. C., J. Paradis, and E. Barrett. [_The Mayfield Handbook of Technical & Scientific Writing_](http://www.mhhe.com/mayfieldpub/tsw/home.htm).
    *   [A few paraphrasing examples and guidelines](https://wts.indiana.edu/writing-guides/plagiarism.html)
*   [MIT Policies and Procedures for Dealing with Academic Dishonesty](http://web.mit.edu/policies/10/10.2.html).

Finally, in order for you to have the best learning experience possible, and to maintain a fair playing field for all students in the class, we ask that you do not look at completed assignments for similar modules run in previous years.
